MH Free Gifts for WooCommerce gives store owners a powerful yet intuitive way to reward customers with a choice of complimentary products.

== Description ==

MH Free Gifts for WooCommerce gives store owners a powerful yet intuitive way to reward customers with a choice of complimentary products. In the admin area, you can define multiple “gift rules”—each with its own name, description, date range, user- or product-dependencies, usage limits, cart subtotal/quantity conditions, and gift-selection options. A sleek toggle switch lets you activate or disable any rule on the fly, and AJAX-powered SelectWoo pickers make it effortless to search and assign products or specific users. All data is stored in a dedicated database table for maximum performance and portability.

On the storefront, customers who meet your criteria will see a responsive, grid-based “Choose Your Free Gift” section on the cart (and optionally checkout) page. They can click to add their selected gift directly—automatically applied at $0—and the system enforces per-rule and per-user limits. Behind the scenes, session and usage-tracking ensure rules aren’t abused, while the engine efficiently evaluates cart contents and applies discounts before totals are calculated. The result is a fully self-contained plugin that seamlessly extends WooCommerce’s promotion capabilities without clutter or conflict.
