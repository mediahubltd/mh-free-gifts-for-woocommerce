Offer free gifts automatically in WooCommerce! Set up smart rules based on cart value, items, or user roles — fully supports WooCommerce Blocks.

== Description ==

**MH Free Gifts for WooCommerce** gives store owners a powerful yet intuitive way to reward customers with complimentary products based on custom cart rules.

### ✨ Key Features

* 🎁 **Add Multiple Free Gift Rules** — create unlimited gift rules with different conditions and products.
* ⚙️ **Smart Rule Conditions & Limits** — restrict by subtotal, quantity, date range, product, or user.
* 🧩 **WooCommerce Blocks Support** — compatible with both classic and block-based cart and checkout.
* 🚀 **Lightweight & Optimized** — uses a dedicated database table for speed and reliability.
* 💯 **Completely Free** — no upsells or pro version. 100% functional out of the box.

### 🛒 How It Works

1. Define your free gift rules in the admin — choose eligible products, usage limits, and visibility options.  
2. Customers who qualify see a responsive **“Choose Your Free Gift”** section on the cart (and optionally checkout) page.  
3. When a gift is selected, it’s automatically added to the cart at $0.  
4. MH Free Gifts handles all validation and limits automatically.

Behind the scenes, the plugin intelligently evaluates cart contents, enforces limits, and prevents abuse — creating a **seamless, self-contained gifting experience** that enhances WooCommerce’s promotion capabilities without extra plugins or conflicts.
